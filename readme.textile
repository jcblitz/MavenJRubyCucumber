h1. Hello and welcome to this demo.

I came across "Cucumber":http://cukes.info/ the other day when looking to start a demo project using "easyby":http://www.easyb.org/ and was doing research. It looks really cool but I wasn't completely enamored with it until I saw Ryan's "Beginning with Cucumber":http://railscasts.com/episodes/155-beginning-with-cucumber and "More on Cucumber":http://railscasts.com/episodes/159-more-on-cucumber

After watching both, I loved it! I started a new rails app just to drive right in, I didn't even have a goal. But then I realized you can run this on Java apps using JRuby and sure enough, led me to "JRuby and Java":http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/jruby-and-java and linked me over to "Binil's blog":http://binil.wordpress.com/2008/10/29/running-cucumber-on-jrubymaven/

So here it is, a simple demo. I uses a simple shopping cart concept with the following Classes:

* Cart
* CartItem
* Product

I'm sure there will be more, but it's just for learning. 

*Please let me know if you spot anything that is awful, I'm always looking to improve*
